15/09/2025,Ticket,It would be great if crefits showed during the conversations. ,75705983
15/09/2025,Ticket,But I would love to have a certain daily limit or unlimited usage for a monthly fee. Of course regular users can be charged as per minute.   But I am sure your regular customers would love the benefits :-),31477112

15/09/2025,Ticket,"Hey, I think being able to see a timer for how much time has elapsed would be a great improvement moment on the app. Why should on the readers get to know how much time we have. I think that’s unfair because some actually use that against us customers. They take their time using the time so they can get money out of us and we barely get anything in return. ",34637780

16/09/2025,Interview,"from the interview: "" have one idea that I think I mentioned before that I have an open membership I pay an amount throughout the month and then I can access the psychic anytime I want without charge on every chat I enter and I think it's costy for me. So I would recommend to 200 or 100 or whatever you find it suitable like an average. So I buy a subscription and then I can access the psychic anytime I want even when I don't have money because I already paid for it. know you know what I'm saying?""",29064537
18/09/2024,Ticket,"What do you think should be improved in a first place? It's very very expensive and the timer is questionable (the minutes are counted down too fast sometimes, you feel a bit cheated). The psychics should also stop using words like 'sweetie, sweetheart, darling, honey' when addressing the clients...it feels cheap and very disingenuous. I hope it is always confidential and an honest service. Not AI or something like that. ",75066433

23/07/2025,Ticket,Oh a suggestion that I was thinking of is a search. When I am in the app you’re not able to save comments. So it would be nice to have a search function.  This is so either you (my self) can locate someone thing I asked to the physic/advisor or they answered to me that wasn’t saved. Please let me know if this doesn’t make sense. ,34120456

,,,
20/10/2025,Ticket,"Also, I find it a bit hard to schedule a reading or healing session, even if I agree with Silvia or MysticTara, because the concept on the app is “first comes first grabs” - and even if we say at 7pm, I log on and have to wait up to several hours before they are online again - just because they “can’t” decline a request - right? Can they see before who is trying  to connect with them?
My point is, it would be really amazing if a booking system feature existed- then I KNOW I actually have a session rather than “maybe”…",23499030

22/10/2025,Ticket,"I have been chatting with Laurelisa just now thankfully. However I left the app for a moment to google the meaning of a word she had used, but as soon as I returned she was allocated to a different consultation. As we were right in the middle of a conversation, this is not great. It should be possible to reserve the conversation for a couple of minutes in this scenario 
I look forward to hearing from you when my suggestions have been implemented 
1) scheduling a time to talk with an advisor
2) having a few minutes to leave the app and return without exiting the session 
Tina thanks for the gesture. However the length of time Laurelisa takes over her consultations means keeping the Nebula app open while
I wait for my turn just is not practical. ",79244705

I just don’t want to keep charging my account repeatedly because the options are limited. When I could do a single charge of any amount I want. Amounts like $5,$15, $30, $40, $60, $75, $150. Right now it’s multiple charges of lower or higher amounts to get close to those. Banks also don’t like seeing the repeated transactions of the same amount and flags it. ",73582093

Limited amount of psychics.
Their answers are of higher quality and deeper. Several paragraphs which they are rated on typing speed.
- Are there specific features or behaviors their psychics have that stand out?
The psychics don’t keep reaching out with GPT messages or tapping into my energy with no permission.
- How does the experience feel compared to Nebula - more personal, more curated, more calm?
It’s anonymous, no account needed and there’s an option to delete the chat. Payment can be made by Apple so there’s privacy with the bank.

03/12/2025,Ticket,"I’ve been saving up the cashback with the plan to eventually make a substantial transfer back into my credits, so I wanted to share a suggestion that could add value for both users and the platform.

The 3% is definitely helpful, but when you consider it in the context of frequent high-value purchases, like the $99.99 transactions many of us make, the benefit is still quite small. Users who purchase often, myself included, engage with the app extensively, and I think there’s a great opportunity to recognise and further encourage that loyalty.

One idea could be a tiered loyalty cashback system, for example:
After three purchases, the cashback percentage could increase;
After five purchases, it could increase again;
And for users who reach ten purchases, an enhanced reward could apply, such as receiving 2,700 additional free credits after making a $99.99 purchase. This would be a bonus on top of the purchase, not replacing the standard credits.
Even small increases like these would make a meaningful difference for users who consistently support the platform, while still being minimal compared to the overall spend. It would genuinely feel like value being added back to loyal users and would continue encouraging long-term engagement.
Copy-paste would also be helpful .
